## About Me
Hello, I'm Luana! a Fullstack Student Dev from Brazil. 
I have a passion for both computer science and philosophy. My coding journey includes working with C/C++, C#, JS and React, and I primarily use Arch Linux as my operating system. Besides programming, I'm deeply interested in topics related to german idealism, pure mathematics, anime, cute stuff and psychoanalysis.

## Coding Workflow
I have a structured coding workflow that helps me stay productive:
- For C# development -> Rider.
- For everything else -> Vim.

Feel free to explore my projects and reach out to me for collaborations or discussions related to programming, philosophy, or anything else that interests you, cheers!
